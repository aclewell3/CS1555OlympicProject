To run the program, make sure that ojdbc7.jar is in the same folder as Olympic.java.

To compile:
	javac -cp "ojdbc7.jar;." Olympic.java
	
To run:
	java -cp "ojdbc7.jar;." Olympic
	
	
There will be menus showing how to navigate through the different menu options.

All user input should be accepted and handled by Olympic.java but
this code will only work if one of the choices given in a menu is selected with the 
corresponding number shown. Otherwise, the wrong input will be handled and expressed to the user.

Please contact me at alc261@pitt.edu if the code doesn't compile or run as expected
since it currently works as expected on my machine.
