To run the Olympic.java program, make sure that ojdbc7.jar is in the same folder as Olympic.java.

To compile:
	javac -cp "ojdbc7.jar;." Olympic.java
	
To run:
	java -cp "ojdbc7.jar;." Olympic
	
	
There will be menus showing how to navigate through the different menu options.

All user input should be accepted and handled by Olympic.java but
this code will only work if one of the choices given in a menu is selected with the 
corresponding number shown. Otherwise, the wrong input will be handled and expressed to the user.

To run the Driver.java program, make sure that ojdbc7.jar is in the same folder as Driver.java

To compile:
	javac -cp "ojdbc7.jar;." Driver.java
	
To run:
	java -cp "ojdbc7.jar;." Driver
	
This will simulate all of the functions in the Olympic.java program.
The matching simulations in are in the queries.sql file that show the same outputs.

Please contact me at alc261@pitt.edu if the code doesn't compile or run as expected
since it currently works as expected on my machine.
